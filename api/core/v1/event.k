schema Event:
    """
    Event is a report of an event somewhere in the cluster.  Events have a limited retention time and triggers and messages may evolve with time.  Event consumers should not rely on the timing of an event with a given Reason reflecting a consistent underlying trigger, or the continued existence of events with that Reason.  Events should be treated as informative, best-effort, supplemental data.

        What action was taken/failed regarding to the Regarding object.
    apiVersion : str, default is "v1", required
        APIVersion defines the versioned schema of this representation of an object. Servers should convert recognized schemas to the latest internal value, and may reject unrecognized values. More info: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#resources
    count : int, default is Undefined, optional
        The number of times this event has occurred.

        The object that this event is about.
    kind : str, default is "Event", required
        Kind is a string value representing the REST resource this object represents. Servers may infer this from the endpoint the client submits requests to. Cannot be updated. In CamelCase. More info: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#types-kinds
    lastTimestamp : str, default is Undefined, optional
        The time at which the most recent occurrence of this event was recorded.

        A human-readable description of the status of this operation.

        Standard object's metadata. More info: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#metadata
    reason : str, default is Undefined, optional
        This should be a short, machine understandable string that gives the reason for the transition into the object's current status.
